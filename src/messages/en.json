      "title": "Pokémon Memory Card Game",
      "description": "The Pokémon Memory Card Game is an interactive web application built to test memory, focus, and attention to detail through a fun and nostalgic Pokémon theme. Players must click on unique Pokémon cards without selecting the same one twice. Each selection reshuffles the entire grid, increasing both challenge and replayability. The game tracks the player’s current and highest scores, encouraging improvement with every session.",
      "overview": "This project demonstrates strong skills in modern frontend development using React, TypeScript, and Vite. It connects to the PokéAPI to dynamically fetch Pokémon data, displaying both sprites and names to enhance the visual experience. The design focuses on clean state management, efficient re-renders, and interactive feedback loops. Through this project, I explored the use of hooks for state handling, component reusability, and data fetching optimizations—all crucial for building scalable, performant web applications.",

      "title": "Battleship Game",
      "description": "The Battleship Game is a classic player-versus-computer strategy game where the goal is to sink all of the opponent’s ships before they sink yours. Players can place ships manually or randomize their positions and then take turns firing at the enemy grid through an intuitive graphical interface.",
      "overview": "This project showcases object-oriented design in Java combined with a graphical user interface to deliver an interactive game experience. It features configurable difficulty levels, manual or random ship placement, and clearly defined game flow from setup to win condition. The implementation emphasizes encapsulated game logic, turn-based mechanics, and user-friendly controls such as reset and start buttons.",
      "details": [
        "Implemented core Battleship mechanics in Java using object-oriented principles for ships, boards, and game flow.",
        "Created a graphical gameboard interface that allows players to place ships, start the game, and select targets visually.",
        "Added both Easy and Normal difficulty modes to adjust the computer opponent’s behavior.",
        "Supported manual and random ship placement so players can choose their preferred setup style.",
        "Included reset and start controls to quickly restart matches or re-randomize ship positions.",
        "Designed turn-based player versus computer gameplay, alternating moves until one fleet is completely destroyed.",
        "Documented potential future improvements such as animations, improved AI, and multiplayer support."

    "intro": "I am a software developer with a background in application development and a strong interest in building clear, well-structured user interfaces. My work focuses primarily on JavaScript and TypeScript, with experience in Java and object-oriented programming. I value clean code, understandable structure, and solutions that are easy to maintain and reason about over time.Through my background in design and UX, I pay close attention to usability, accessibility, and visual clarity — not as decoration, but as part of good software design. I enjoy working on projects where logic, structure, and user experience come together in a coherent whole.",
